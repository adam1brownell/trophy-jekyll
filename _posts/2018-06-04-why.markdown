## Why did I start this blog?
1. To Sharpen the Saw
This idea comes from the book [Seven Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01069X4H0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) ([summary](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/habits-of-highly-effective-people-summary)):
###### To Renew yourself...
|Physically|Spiritually|Mentally|Emotionally|
|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
|Eat Well  |Meditate   |Read    |Seek Friend| 

2. To Keep myself Accountable 
.. 
3. To Be Who I Am Becoming. To Start today
*Doing* is the hardest part of anything. Writing this first post was *hard.* I kept second guessing my word-choice, my tone, and my style. But really those are trivial concerns in comparison to actually producing content. As Ze Frank says :
