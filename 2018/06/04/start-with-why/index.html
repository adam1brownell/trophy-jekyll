      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how" - Nietzsche</code></p>

<p>Whenever I let slip to my friends and family that I was interested in starting a blog, I was almost always asked the same question.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Apparently “for fun” wasn’t a satisfactory answer. Nor was the more accurate answer “I want to talk about the brain and robots all the time.” I realized if I wanted to be successful in blogging, my reason for blogging had to go deeper than fun.</p>

<h1 id="why-did-i-start-this-blog">Why did I start this blog?</h1>

<h2 id="1-to-sharpen-the-saw">1. To Sharpen the Saw</h2>

<p>This idea comes from the book Seven Habits of Highly Effective People (<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/habits-of-highly-effective-people-summary">summary</a>). In order to be effective, we have to devote time to renewing ourselves in key areas of our psyche– you need to keep your saw sharp.</p>

<p>You can see from the <strong>bolded</strong> activities that the process of reading, understanding, and blogging will keep me my spirits and morale high. Pursuing this side project will leave me refreshed!</p>

<p>In a fast-paced high stress world, it is nice to have a platform and activity that is all my own. There are no barriers to entry– just me dedicating time and effort to something personal that will pay dividends even without an audience.</p>

<p>I am doing this for me. An audience is just a bonus.</p>
<h2 id="2-to-be-who-i-am-becoming">2. To Be Who I Am Becoming</h2>

<p>I want to be a thought leader in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. That is something I would find deeply fulfilling. This blog is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Practice is vital in the journey of mastery. To be a master, you must fall in love with the process. - George Leonard</code></p>

<p>Continually blogging is the best strategy for cultivating  mastery of the subject. Researching relevant topics will help me practice and improve. Falling in love // getting excited about blog posts will keep me motivated, improving, and learning.</p>

<p>I may not be the most informed researcher or the best writer, but if my content is interesting/useful to me hopefully others will feel the same way.</p>

<p>Information is so widely available now that it would be a missed opportunity not to try to take advantage. Becoming adept at learning outside of the classroom is crucial to success.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune - Jim Rohn</code></p>

<h2 id="3-to-keep-myself-accountable">3. To Keep Myself Accountable</h2>

<p>All of this is all talk unless I actually do something about it.</p>

<p>Setting good goals and keeping myself accountable is 80% of the work it takes for me to finish a project or start a new habit. If I have to produce results or hit metrics for someone to see, I am WAY more likely to succeed in my endevour.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Accountability is the glue that ties commitment to result. - Bob Proctor</code></p>

<p>Becoming an expert in CogSci/AI is my <strong>goal</strong>. This blog is my <strong>deliverable</strong>.  Producing consistent, high quality, and easy to digest content is my <strong>metric</strong> for success.</p>

<h2 id="4-to-start">4. To Start</h2>
<p><strong>Starting</strong> is the hardest part of anything. Writing this first post was <em>hard.</em> I kept second guessing my word-choice, my tone, and my style. But really those are trivial concerns in comparison to actually producing content.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">My pencils are sharp enough. Even the dull ones will make a mark - Ze Frank</code></p>

<p>Actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g">here</a> is Ze Frank’s <em>Invocation for Beginnings</em> speech, one of my all time favorites. It is incredible. Might get it tatoo’d on myself. What I love about Ze’s speach is that is strikes at the heart of what keeps me from starting– from past failures to comparisons to bad impulses– and how to deal with each in turn. I could do a whole blog post on the poem…</p>

<p>I view this post as a living document; a space I can come back to and re-edict when I think of new reasons to write, and a space I rely on to recharge my motivation.</p>

<p>I’m excited to begin this adventure.</p>
